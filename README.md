# Amazon Vine Analysis

### Overview of the Analysis

The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. By running an analysis on the Tools product category, we can determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.

### Results

The images aboe shows us that thtere were 285 Vine reviews vs 31452 non-Vine reviews, highlighting that there's more opportunity to get additional Vine reviews from Vine members. Of the Vine reviews, 163 reviews were 5-star, which is about 57% of Vine reviews. In comparision, non-Vine reviews had 14603 5-star reviews which is about 46% of non-Vine reviews.  

### Summary

Given that Vine reviews makes up less than 1% of helpful votes data, the impact of these reviews is rather small compared to the overall volume of reviews. Additional, with the percent of 5-star Vine reviews being relatively close to non-Vine reviews, it does not appear that this program is helping to increase high-ranking reviews that would be valuable to manufactures. Additionally, analysis should be performed on the volume of helpful reviews to determine if the Vine program offers improved review quality.
